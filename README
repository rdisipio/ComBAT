### Requirements to use the package: BAT-0.3.2 properly installed
Set the following environment variables:
BATINSTALLDIR   -> full path to the BAT installation directory 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH -> ROOT lib directory and $BATINSTALLDIR/lib
CPATH           -> $CPATH and $BATINSTALLDIR/include

Running:
> make
> ./runTopComb


runTopComb.cxx    -> steering program
                     here you can choose the input control cards (see below)
                     to select the channels to combine (leton+jets or 
                     dilepton or both)
TopComb.cxx, .h   -> BAT standard class which define run parameters 
                     loglikelihoods and priors   
InputData.cxx, .h -> Class to manage the input from card file 
ljets.cards       -> example of card file for lepton+jets (e/mu channels) 
                     combination
dilep.cards       -> example of card file for dilepton (ee/mumu/emu channels) 
                     combination
ljets_dilep.cards -> example of card file for lepton+jets + dilepton
                     combination
TopComb_plots.ps  -> output plots
